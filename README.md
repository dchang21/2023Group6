## 2. Further Info

### 2.1 Issue Posting
Please check the _Projects_ tab for an overview of development. If a new work item is needed, please add an "issue" to _Issues_ before we accept it into _Projects_.

### 2.2 Development Usage

#### 2.2.1 Running Steps: (Assumes all dependencies are present.)
 1. See https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/tutorial/fact for a quick overview.
 2. $ flask --app eureka run
 3. Enter `cd eurekaeats` for frontend.
 4. Enter `npm start` to run the React development server. The page should open up automatically.
 5. SIGINT with `CTRL+C` to stop the testrun.

#### 2.2.2 Testing Tips:
 - Command: `python -m pytest .` runs _all_ unit tests.
    - Unit tests are _very_ incomplete for now, as they only test some dummy user API functions.

#### 2.2.3 Misc. Tips:
 - The `config.py` file has been added to the repo for easy access, but it is still unsafe to put custom secret strings in the settings. Please use a `.env` file on your computer instead for database login info.

### 2.3.0 How to set up YELP FUSION API to database
1. YELP FUSION API setup
   - get an API KEY from https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app
   - create a .env file and store the key as `YELP_API_KEY = 'the api key'`
2. Setup MongoDB to connect to VSCODE
   - Download VScode with MongoDb extension
   - Add MongoDb connection from your local host
- Database name will be `EurekaEats`
- Collection will be `restaurants`
